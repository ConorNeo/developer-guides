[#connecting-aura]
== Connect to your AuraDB database

If you log in to your AuraDB database using the AuraDB console, for any running database, you can simply open Neo4j Browser for that database using the *Open* button on the console.

Provided the database is running, you can also connect to it from a Web browser by entering this URL:

----
https://dbid.databases.neo4j.io/browser/
----

Where you specify the *dbid* for your database. Neo4j Browser will connect to the database after you provide the username/password for the database.
The default user name is `neo4j` and the password is what was generated or specified when the database was created.

These tutorials explain how to connect to your AuraDB database from other Neo4j tools.
