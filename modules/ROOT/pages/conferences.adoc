https://www.jfokus.se/talks/973[Building secure GraphQL APIs without the Boilerplate^]

**Abstract:** +
While GraphQL APIs are one of the hottest trends in API development, they are no magic bullet. You still have to write a lot of resolver-code, adjust your API to changing schemas, figure out database performance and handle security properly.

Backing a GraphQL API with a graph database makes several of these things easier. Queries and mutations can be generated from the schema, GraphQL queries are directly translated into join-free database queries and with built in security directives you can integrate with auth providers and database security.

In this talk I want to walk you through building a GraphQL API for a conference system from scratch, discussing and demonstrating these aspects live.
