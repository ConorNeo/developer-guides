**Abstract:**
Most developers have dealt or are dealing with monoliths. What if we could swap the fortress for battle units to improvise, adapt, and overcome their enemies? This session will use live demos to take you from Level 1 Sorcerer to Level 20 with basics of microservice chatter to whole pipeline.
