Alternatively, Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its bolt and HTTP APIs. We recommend the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client#roadmap[PHP Client^] for easiest development over bolt and HTTP APIs. You can also directly access the bolt protocol via the https://github.com/stefanak-michal/Bolt[PHP Bolt] library.

[#Client]
== Full client

*Neo4j-php-client* is a client supporting multiple protocols. *Http* and *bolt* are supported, starting from neo4j 3.5 up until the most recent version.

It boasts many features such as multiple connections, transactions functions, authentication and auto-routing. It also integrates with the psalm static analysis tool for complete type safety.

It is being actively developed and has a big readme file on the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client[Github page^].
